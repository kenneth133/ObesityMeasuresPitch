## Body Mass Index (BMI)

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/1/6/8168b66b1b9395a9b7c8fb7052d0d610.png" />
* Created in the 1800s by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet and adopted during the late 20th century.
* Has become the standard measure of obesity (or lack thereof), used by governments, drug manufacturers, physicians and would-be dieters.
* However, BMI is not suitable for everyone because it can incorrectly flag athletic or particularly muscular people as overweight.
* Most pro football players in the NFL would be classified as obese using BMI.
    * The average defensive lineman weighs 131 kg and stands 1.91 meters tall.
    * `BMI = 131 / 1.91^2 = 35.91 [severely obese]`

## Waist-Hip Ratio

<p style="font-family:georgia">Waist-Hip Ratio = waist circumference / hip circumference</p>

* Waist-to-hip ratio is a better gauge of obesity than BMI.
* Accounts for excess fat around the midsection.
* Better indicator of visceral fat, which is particularly dangerous.
* The average NFL defensive lineman has waist and hip measures of 107 and 120.
* `Waist-Hip Ratio = 107 / 120 = 0.89 [no increase in risk of metabolic complications]`
